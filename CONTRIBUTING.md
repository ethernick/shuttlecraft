Contributions of any kind are welcome. However, this is a personal project
and is casually maintained by Ben Brown. At this point, you should not 
expect a fully operational open source project.

- I reserve the right to reject any contribution for any reason.

- Our goal is to avoid using any large framework or dependency such as React.
  PRs that introduce new dependencies require special justification.

- Before doing any major work, first open an issue describing the problem 
  that needs solving. Have a discussion with @benbrown about it.
